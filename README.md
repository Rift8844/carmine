## Description
Carmine is a smart web themeing javascript module.
Carmine can generate a theme for any website given
a list of colors. Carmine will group all elements
based on their background color, and assign each group
of elements the most appropriate color from the list.
Carmine will also adjust the chosen colors from the list
to preserve the saturation and luminance differences in
the web page.
Discontinued probably like forever, and it's pretty horrible code too.

## Installation
Carmine requires tinycolor.js to run. Make sure to have
tiny color running when you run carmine!

(8/2/21): My code here was so horrible, that I'm seriously considering making this private to spare myself the embarassment.
